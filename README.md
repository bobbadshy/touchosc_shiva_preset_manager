    - any of the preset buttons in Direct access mode.
- Fail-safe load and save
- Automatic and manual preset crossfading
- "Randomize all controls now!" option (available in the interactive settings).

### Re-using the self-contained on-screen keyboard group for your own surfaces

The on-screen keyboard (control group `groupKeyboard`) used in the preset manager is self-contained and re-useable. 
If you want to use it separately in your control surfaces, you can copy just the `groupKeyboard` to anywhere in your surface.

The keyboard control will set itself to visible and interactive upone receiving a notify() message, and hide itself again upon closing.

Short demo video on how to copy and use it in your template:

<details>

<summary>LUA script for using the keyboard group with arbitrary controls:  (click to expand)</summary>

- From your label or text control, use a lua script to send a `notify()` message to the keyboard group:

  ```
  -- reference to the keyboard control
  local kbd = self.parent.children.groupKeyboard

  function onValueChanged(k)
    -- send on toucch relase
    if k == 'touch' and not self.values.touch then
      -- it sends its own ID and its text value
      kbd:notify(self.ID, self.values.text)
    end
  end

  function onReceiveNotify(cmd, text)
  -- receive the updated text back from keyboard control
    self.values.text = text
  end
  ```
</details>

## Bug reports, Feature Suggestions or Contributing

*As the version  tags suggest, this is currently a brand new project. The first public release was Jan 2025. So, while it seems to work really well already, please keep in mind that it is **currently in testing and not ready for production**. Thank you!*

Please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/bobbadshy/touchosc_shiva_preset_manager/issues) section.

As this is just a hobby project in my freetime, I cannot promise I will get to any of them, but nevertheless, suggestions and bug reports are welcome! üôÇ

If you have any ideas or want to contribute to the project yourself, feel free to fork it and submit the changes back to me.

## Planned features wishlist

- Support send/receive presets over MIDI SysEx, for persistent storage e.g. in a MIDI Librarian, or for ***live sharing over MIDI with other users that use the same OSC template for their gear :).*** See [discussion](https://github.com/bobbadshy/touchosc_shiva_preset_manager/discussions/8) and [MidiHax repo](https://github.com/MidiHax/touchosc-confirm-button) with the code snippets for handling MIDI SysEx encoding/decoding in TouchOSC templates.
- Place the presets table globally, as a sibling to the preset module. This will allow upgrading the preset manager module without losing your presets :)
- ...no others at the moment, but who knows what tomorrow morning's coffee will bring ;) ...
