# "Shiva" Preset Manager

*Shiva Preset Manager* is a sophisticated preset module that can be added to TouchOSC control surfaces.

### Supported features:
- Select controls by:
  - MIDI message attached
  - OSC message attached *(**experimental** ..might need further refinement for the selection process!)*
  - All controls whose tag field starts with the string ***"shiva"**
- Regardless of the above mode, controls can always be manually excluded by adding the string **"noshiva"** to the start of the tag field! 
- Optionally limit preset to a certain base group, so multiple preset modules can be added to a surface, e.g. one on every pager page.
- Support saving the following TouchOSC values:
  - `x` (buttons, faders etc.)
  - `text` (labels, multi-line text controls)
  - `xy`(XY panels)
- Preset name editor.
  - Tap on the multi-line name display to edit the currenttly active preset name.
- Direct access load mode
- Small collapsed mode (tap on heading)
- Extended manager mode (for saving and loading)
- Cut, copy-&-paste, or delete presets between preset slots through context menu.
  - The context menu is invoked when you long-tap (hold) on:
    - the selected preset no. display, or
    - any of the preset buttons in Direct access mode.
- Fail-safe load and save
- Automatic and manual preset crossfading
- Last preset is automatically loaded on surface startup.
- Auto-detect and indicate if controls have been modified since last preset loading.
  - Tap on the single-line preset info display to *blink ;)* all controls that currently differ from preset values.
- Restore controls working state cache with 10 undo steps, if you accidently loaded a preset and want to revert to a previous working state.
- A basic skin settings config to allow quick changes to colors, borders, backgrounds, etc. of elements.
- ...

### Usage

- Download and open the preset module `.tosc` file in the TouchOSC editor.

### Bug reports and feature suggestions

*As the version  tags suggest, this is currently a brand new project. The first public release was Jan 2025. So, while it seems to work really well already, please keep in mind that it is **currently in testing and not ready for production**. Thank you!*

Please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/bobbadshy/touchosc_shiva_preset_manager/issues) section.

As this is just a hobby project in my freetime, I cannot promise I will get to any of them, but nevertheless, suggestions and bug reports are welcome! ðŸ™‚
