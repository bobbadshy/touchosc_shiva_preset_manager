## Supported features:
- Select controls by:
  - MIDI message attached
  - OSC message attached
  - Special string prefixes at start of a control's tag field value: In addition to MIDI or OSC message select mode, controls can always be explicitly included or excluded by adding on of the strings **"shiva"** or **"noshiva"** to the start of any contol's tag! 
- Optionally limit preset to a certain base group, so multiple preset modules can be added to a surface, e.g. one on every pager page.
- Saves the controls' `x`, `y`, and `text` values into the preset.
- ***Interactive settings:*** The above settings can be changed on-the-fly in the running TouchOS surface:
  - Long-tap (hold) the toggle icon on the title bar to open the settings page.
  - When choosing the control select mode in the settings, the number of recognized controls is indicated, and all selected controls are blinked shortly.
- Preset name editor.
  - Tap on the bigger multi-line name display to edit the currently active preset name.
- Direct access load mode
- Small collapsed mode (tap on heading)
- Extended manager mode (for saving and loading):
  - Switch between modes by tapping the toggle icon on the title bar.
- Copy, paste, and delete presets between preset slots through context menu.
  - The context menu is invoked when you long-tap (hold) on:
    - the small selected preset no. display in Extended mode, or
    - any of the preset buttons in Direct access mode.
- Fail-safe load and save
- Automatic and manual preset crossfading
- "Randomize all controls now!" option (available in the interactive settings).
- Last preset is automatically loaded on surface startup.
- Auto-detect and indicate if controls have been modified since last preset loading.
  - Tap on the single-line preset info display to *blink ;)* all controls that currently differ from preset values.
- Restore controls working state cache with 10 undo steps, if you accidently loaded a preset and want to revert to a previous working state.
- A basic skin settings config group in TouchOSC Editor view, to allow quick changes to colors, borders, backgrounds, etc. of elements, and apply those changes at startup.

## Bug reports, Feature Suggestions or Contributing

*As the version  tags suggest, this is currently a brand new project. The first public release was Jan 2025. So, while it seems to work really well already, please keep in mind that it is **currently in testing and not ready for production**. Thank you!*

Please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/bobbadshy/touchosc_shiva_preset_manager/issues) section.

As this is just a hobby project in my freetime, I cannot promise I will get to any of them, but nevertheless, suggestions and bug reports are welcome! üôÇ

If you have any ideas or want to contribute to the project yourself, feel free to fork it and submit the changes back to me.

## Planned features wishlist

- Support send/receive presets over MIDI SysEx, for persistent storage e.g. in a MIDI Librarian, or for ***live sharing over MIDI with other users that use the same OSC template for their gear :).*** See [discussion](https://github.com/bobbadshy/touchosc_shiva_preset_manager/discussions/8) and [MidiHax repo](https://github.com/MidiHax/touchosc-confirm-button) with the code snippets for handling MIDI SysEx encoding/decoding in TouchOSC templates.
- ...no others at the moment, but who knows what tomorrow morning's coffee will bring ;) ...
